## Quality Tree

| Quality Category       | Quality                   | Significance | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Usability              | User interface aesthetics | **must**     | Follow brand guidelines but adapted to applications with allowance for smaller deviations.                                                                                                                                            |
|                        | Accessibility             | should       | A11Y is only measurable in final app. The design system should provide accessible widgets and usage guidelines to push apps into the pit of success.                                                                                  |
|                        | Learnability              | **must**     | We want an intuitive component API that follows standards and best practices in the ecosystem and is easy to learn and intuitive to use.                                                                                              |
|                        | User error protection     | should       | The design system must not crash an application. No memory-leaks and infinity-loops.                                                                                                                                                  |
| Maintainability        | Modularity                | **must**     | We have to maintain in our 20% time. Quickly be productive. Make Contributions easy for outside project members.                                                                                                                      |
|                        | Reusability               | should       | The design system should not include app-specific components. Focus on reusable components.                                                                                                                                           |
|                        | Testability               | should       | Should be automatically tested for visual regression, API stability, and correctness.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Portability            | Installability            | should       | It should be installable with few and easy steps and have a well documented "Getting Started" guide.                                                                                                                                  |
|                        | Adaptability              | could        | Do we only build it for our own or create a white-label system that can be themable for customer projects as well? Getting white-label right is really hard. We already define tokens (themable) but the focus is not on white-label. |
| Compatibility          | Interoperability          | **must**     | We want to be usable by all internal web projects. Since we don't have technology standards, we need to be interoperable.                                                                                                             |
| Performance efficiency | Resource utilization      | could        | Our target group has powerful devices. We should have resources in mind and not actively make it bad, but it is not a focus.                                                                                                          |
