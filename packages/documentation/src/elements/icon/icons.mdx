# Icons

We want to showcase 2 sizes of a selection of icons from
[Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) that you can find in the stories in this folder.
They are meant for demonstration but we encourage to use one of the
[packages](https://lucide.dev/packages) provided by Lucide to suit your project.

But we provide a base css class that you should use and extend in your project
to adhere to the principles of the Design System. The main class `.hap-icon` is
meant for a default size while adding `.small` as another class in your html
will use a smaller size.

```css
.hap-icon {
  stroke: currentColor;
  stroke-width: 1.5;
  stroke-opacity: 0.8;
  height: 24px;
  width: 24px;
  stroke-linecap: round;
  stroke-linejoin: round;

  &.hap-icon--small {
    height: 16px;
    width: 16px;
  }
}
```
