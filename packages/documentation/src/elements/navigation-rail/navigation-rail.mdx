# Navigation Rail

Navigation Rails provide access to the application's main destinations,
especially on tablet and desktop devices. For the navigation rail items, there
is one main-class `.hap-navigation-rail-item`. The sizing happens automatically
based on the selected icon-size. For a special 'selected'-state, use the
additional `.hap-navigation-rail-item--selected` class.
