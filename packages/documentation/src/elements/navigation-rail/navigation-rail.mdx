Navigation Rails provide access to the application's main destinations,
especially on tablet and desktop devices.

# Navigation Rail Items

For the navigation rail items, there is one main-class
`.hap-navigation-rail-item`. The sizing happens automatically based on the
selected icon-size. For a special 'selected'-state, use the additional
`.hap-navigation-rail-item--selected` class.
