# Divider

The following kinds of dividers are available:

## Divider Default

<Canvas of={DividerStories.Default} />

## Divider Vertical

There is no native vertical divider available in HTML for several reasons.
Still, it can be achieved by using a normal `hr` element and either setting the
height and width accordingly or putting it into a parent with `flex`. The CSS
classes used here are just for showcasing and we encourage to use other ways of
using vertical dividers.
