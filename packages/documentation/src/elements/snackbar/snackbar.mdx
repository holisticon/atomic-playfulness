# Snackbar

Snackbars present short Meldungen about processes at the bottom edge of the
screen. Optionally, they may offer actions or a closing option.

> Note: As the width of a snackbar might depend on application specific
> requirements, it will always fill the whole width of the parent container.

## Single Line (default)

<Canvas of={AlertStories.SingleLine} />
