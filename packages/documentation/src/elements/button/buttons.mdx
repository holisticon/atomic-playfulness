# Buttons

For the buttons we created two main css classes that can be utilized. The main
one that should be used for buttons is `.hap-button`. There is also a smaller
version of the button that is documented in the respective examples in
storybook. In order to have that style, you have to first use `.hap-button` and
on top of that `.hap-button--small`.

## Primary Button

Besides the css class `.hap-button` the primary button needs the class
`.hap-button--primary` to achieve the showcased styles.
