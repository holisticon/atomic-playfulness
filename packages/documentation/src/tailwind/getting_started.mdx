# Using Our Custom Tailwind Configuration in Another Project

This guide explains how to integrate our custom Tailwind CSS configuration into
another project.

## Prerequisites

- The target project should be using **Tailwind CSS v3**.
- You should have access to our custom Tailwind configuration by installing our
  project.

## Installation

### 1. Install Our Project

To use our custom Tailwind configuration, first install our project:

```sh
npm install @holisticon/hap-foundation @holisticon/hap-tailwind
```

Or using yarn:

```sh
yarn add @holisticon/hap-foundation @holisticon/hap-tailwind
```

### 2. Install Tailwind CSS (if not already installed)

If the target project does not have Tailwind CSS installed, follow the
instructions at https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/installation.

### 3. Use Our Custom Tailwind Config

Ensure that the target project imports and extends our custom Tailwind
configuration in `tailwind.config.js`:

```js
import { theme as hapTheme } from "@holisticon/hap-tailwind";

export default {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],

  theme: {
    extend: hapTheme,
  },

  plugins: [],
};
```

### 4. Configure Tailwind in the Project

#### a) Add a Global Stylesheet

Create a global stylesheet (e.g., `global.css`) in the project and import
Tailwind. Additionally, make sure that `atomic-playfulness.css` is included in
the styles. In this file we provide all the custom CSS tokens that are being
used by the Tailwind config:

```css
@import "@holisticon/hap-foundation/atomic-playfulness.css";

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

#### b) Ensure PostCSS is Configured

If the target project uses PostCSS, make sure `postcss.config.js` is set up
correctly:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

### 5. Restart the Project

After making these changes, restart the development server to apply the custom
Tailwind configuration.

## Tailwind Class Structure

Our custom Tailwind configuration introduces specific class structures based on
design tokens. Here are some key examples:

- **Spacing:** Classes such as `p-md`, `m-xl`, `gap-sm` use values like
  `var(--hap-spacing-md)`, ensuring consistent spacing.
- **Border Radius:** Classes like `rounded-minimal`, `rounded-lg`, and
  `rounded-full` apply predefined radius tokens.
- **Typography:** Font-related classes (`text-headline-lg`, `font-bold`,
  `leading-bodytext-standard`) map to specific variables like
  `var(--hap-typography-font-size-headline-lg)`.
- **Colors:** Classes like `text-primary-onLight`,
  `bg-fill-brand-light-default`, and `border-primary-onDark-default` adapt to
  different themes.
- **Shadows & Opacity:** Custom shadow levels (`shadow-firstLevel`) and opacity
  (`opacity-disabled`, `opacity-hovered`) provide consistent depth and
  visibility handling.

By using these custom class names, you ensure your project maintains a unified
design language with our predefined Tailwind theme.

## Conclusion

The target project should now be using our custom Tailwind configuration. You
can verify by checking if our custom styles and components appear correctly. If
any issues arise, ensure the Tailwind and PostCSS configurations are properly
set up.
