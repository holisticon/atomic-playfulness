# Typography

Atomic Playfulness uses the
[ES Klarheit Kurrent](https://extraset.ch/typefaces/klarheit-kurrent/) and
[ES Klarheit Grotesk](https://extraset.ch/typefaces/klarheit-grotesk/) from
Extraset. They have been licensed for usage by Holisticon but must not be used
by other parties unlicensed.

Typography styles are provided noninvasive as CSS classes, so they don't
interfere with 3rd Party libraries that might be used in addition to Atomic
Playfulness.

## Headings

Headings use the ES Klarheit Kurrent. The following heading styles are provided:

<Typography
  sampleText="Headline 3XL"
  fontClasses={[
    "hap-headline--3xl",
    "hap-headline--2xl",
    "hap-headline--xl",
    "hap-headline--lg",
    "hap-headline--md",
    "hap-headline--sm",
  ]}
></Typography>

## Body Text

For regular body text, ES Klarheit Grotesk is used. The following styles are
provided:

<Typography
  sampleText="The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
  fontClasses={["hap-text", "hap-text--sm", "hap-text--xs"]}
></Typography>
